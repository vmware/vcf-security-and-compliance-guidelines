## Broadcom Resources
We have quite a number of tactical and strategic resources available to users of VMware products, answering many questions.

## Broadcom Support Policies Applicable to Security Hardening
Put simply, Broadcom does not support modifications to appliances or the products outside of the documented upgrade and patching processes. Security Configuration Guides, STIGs,  Compliance Kit, and other official guidance found in the Knowledge Base are all supported where the guidance used matches the version being deployed.

* [VMware Virtual Appliances and Customizations to Operating System and Included Packages](https://knowledge.broadcom.com/external/article?articleNumber=367354)
* [Support for Security Technical Implementation Guides (STIGs)](https://knowledge.broadcom.com/external/article?legacyId=94398)

## Security Configuration & Hardening Guides
The Security Configuration and Hardening Guide (SCG) provides comprehensive recommendations for securing VMware products. It offers detailed instructions and best practices for configuring various vSphere components to enhance security and ensure compliance with industry standards.

## Product Documentation
The product documentation is the reference for how a feature or component works. This repository is meant to augment the product documentation. If the docs answer the question "how?" this repository tries to answer the "why?" or "when?" or "so what?" questions you might have.

* [vSphere 8 Security](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/8.0/vsphere-security/GUID-52188148-C579-4F6A-8335-CFBCE0DD2167.html)
* [vSphere 7 Security](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/7.0/com.vmware.vsphere.security.doc/GUID-52188148-C579-4F6A-8335-CFBCE0DD2167.html)

## VMware Product Security
VMware has a defined Secure Software Development Lifecycle and policies for how issues are assessed and managed.

* [VMware Product Security: An Overview of VMware's Security Programs and Practices](https://www.vmware.com/docs/vmware-product-security-white-paper)
* [VMware External Vulnerability Response and Remediation Policy](https://www.broadcom.com/support/vmware-services/security-response)

## VMware Security Advisories
VMware Security Advisories, or VMSAs, are formal notifications of a vulnerability that has been reported and resolved in VMware products. They contain information about what the problem is and where it is located, the fixed versions, and sometimes include workarounds and other possible defensive posture.

* [Sign Up for Security Alerts via Email](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1l5T1Gndw_0olrZa29B0bbRBy7l701YFrW53P-RF9bKo/viewform?edit_requested=true)

There are no automated vulnerability feeds (RSS or otherwise) available at this time.

## DISA STIG and STIG Readiness Guides
STIGs are comprehensive hardening guides for US Department of Defense (DOD) systems, based on DOD and NIST requirements.

* [Security Technical Implementation Guides (STIGs)](https://www.vmware.com/solutions/security/certifications/stigs)
* [Support Policy for Security Technical Implementation Guides (STIGs)](https://knowledge.broadcom.com/external/article?legacyId=94398)

## VMware Certifications
Broadcom maintains certifications and validations for VMware products that help demonstrate our claims of security are true, and to help ease procurement processes.

* [Common Criteria](https://www.vmware.com/solutions/security/certifications/common-criteria)
* [Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 140-2 & 140-3](https://www.vmware.com/solutions/security/certifications/fips)
* [VMware Cloud Trust Center](https://www.vmware.com/info/trust-center#compliance)

## Secure System Design and Architecture
This section is growing as we update whitepapers and other resources as part of the merger with Broadcom.

* [Best Practices for Patching vSphere](https://github.com/vmware/vcf-security-and-compliance-guidelines/blob/main/security-design/Best-Practices-for-Patching-vSphere.md)
* [Practical Ideas for Ransomware Resilience](https://github.com/vmware/vcf-security-and-compliance-guidelines/blob/main/ransomware-resources/Practical-Ideas-for-Ransomware-Resilience.md)
* [Designing Infrastructure to Defend Against Ransomware](https://github.com/vmware/vcf-security-and-compliance-guidelines/blob/main/ransomware-resources/Designing%20Infrastructure%20to%20Defeat%20Ransomware%20-%2020221024.pdf)
* [Ransomware Defense and Recovery Strategies](https://github.com/vmware/vcf-security-and-compliance-guidelines/blob/main/ransomware-resources/Ransomware%20Defense%20and%20Recovery%20Strategies%20-%2020230425.pdf)

On the surface this doesn't look like secure system design, per se, but less is more when it comes to security. Using VCF means less first-order objects to secure (servers, software, etc.) which, in turn, means less second- and third-order objects to secure (network switches, etc.). That means less staff time used, less money spent, and less risk taken.

## Firewalling and Perimeter Defenses
VMware documents the ports, protocols, and requirements for network connectivity so that enterprise firewall admins have an easier time being specific about rule sets.

* [Ports and Protocols](https://ports.broadcom.com/)
* [vSphere Firewalling Helper](https://github.com/vmware/vcf-security-and-compliance-guidelines/tree/main/security-configuration-hardening-guide/vsphere/8.0): An Excel spreadsheet that has additional information about network communications and firewalling.

## Cryptography, TLS, and Data-in-Transit Security
We have a fair amount of information at the following links:

* [VMware vSphere 8 Default SSL/TLS Cipher Suites](https://github.com/vmware/vcf-security-and-compliance-guidelines/blob/main/regulatory-compliance/vsphere/8.0/VMware-vSphere-8-Default-TLS-Ciphers.md)

## Regulatory Compliance Standards
There are over 700 different regulatory compliance frameworks that VMware customers apply to their environments, not counting ones developed internally by GRC and Infosec groups within customer organizations. As such, we focus on the most common. Some of these are linked below. It is often helpful to read the requirements directly, versus using interpretations by compliance auditors, vulnerability scanner vendors, and so on.
