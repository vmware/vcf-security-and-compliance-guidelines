# Glossary of Security, Compliance, and Operational Resilience | VMware
Access Control
--------------

The process of granting or denying users' access to specific resources based on their identity and permissions. It ensures that only authorized individuals can access sensitive data or perform certain actions within a system.

VMware Cloud Foundation and VMware vSphere implement a robust role-based access control permission model inside VMware vCenter Server, which permits administrators granular control over user permissions and capabilities.

Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)
--------------------------------

A sophisticated, targeted, and prolonged cyberattack in which an intruder gains access to a network and remains undetected for an extended period. APTs are typically carried out by well-funded and organized groups, often with nation-state backing, and aim to steal sensitive data or disrupt critical systems. These attacks are known for their stealth, persistence, and adaptability.

Air Gap
-------

A security measure that involves physically isolating a computer or network from unsecured networks, such as the public internet. This isolation helps prevent unauthorized access and potential threats from affecting the protected system or data.

VMware Cloud Foundation and VMware vSphere support air gapped environments through the limited use of online services and the availability of downloadable offline repositories for patching and updates.

Attacker
--------

An individual or group that attempts to exploit vulnerabilities in systems, networks, or applications to gain unauthorized access, disrupt operations, or steal data. Attackers can be motivated by various factors, such as financial gain, political ideology, or personal reasons.

Authentication
--------------

The ability to prove that a person or application is genuine by verifying the identity of that person or application. Authentication often involves providing credentials, such as a username and password, to confirm that the user or application is who they claim to be. Also see “Multifactor Authentication.”

VMware Cloud Foundation and VMware vSphere components support several different ways to authenticate, using built-in username and password functionality, on-premises identity providers such as Microsoft Active Directory and Active Directory Federation Services, as well as cloud-based providers such as Okta, Microsoft Entra ID, and Ping.

Authorization
-------------

The act of determining whether a user or application has the right to conduct particular activities in a system, relying on authentication to prove the identification of the user or application. Authorization ensures that authenticated users or applications can only perform actions they are permitted to do.

VMware Cloud Foundation and VMware vSphere components support authorization of administrators and users through integrated role-based access control capabilities, as well as through connectivity to external sources such as Microsoft Active Directory and Active Directory Federation Services, Okta, Microsoft Entra ID, and Ping.

Availability
------------

The assurance that a system or resource is accessible and functional when needed. Availability is one of the three core tenets of information security, alongside confidentiality and integrity.

VMware Cloud Foundation and VMware vSphere have numerous availability features to ensure workloads and data remain available, including vMotion and Cross-vCenter vMotion, Distributed Resource Scheduler, vSphere High Availability, Reliable Memory, network and storage I/O control, customizable vSAN storage policies, vSAN stretched clusters, proactive health checks, and more.

Backup
------

The process of creating copies of data to enable recovery in case of data loss or corruption. A proper backup strategy helps organizations restore data and maintain business continuity in the event of a disaster, cyberattack, or system failure. It should include regular, scheduled data copies to separate storage media or systems, version control to maintain multiple historical copies, and a retention policy to ensure that backups are kept for a sufficient period to meet recovery requirements. Additionally, backups should be tested regularly to verify their integrity and the ability to restore data successfully.

It's important to note that storing data on the same device or system as the original data does not qualify as a backup, as it does not protect against hardware failure, theft, or other localized risks. Similarly, using sync services or mirroring alone does not constitute a backup, as changes made to the original data, including deletions or corruptions, are immediately reflected in the synced or mirrored location. Proper backups should be independent of the original data location and protected against common risks**.**

VMware Cloud Foundation and VMware vSphere provide standard APIs and access methods to a large ecosystem of partners specializing in backup and restore software and solutions.

Business Continuity
-------------------

The capability of an organization to maintain essential functions during and after a disruption, such as a natural disaster, cyberattack, or equipment failure. Business continuity planning involves identifying critical processes, developing strategies to minimize disruptions, and ensuring the organization can recover quickly.

VMware Cloud Foundation enables customers to proactively protect their environments and quickly recover from incidents and disasters through VMware Live Recovery, which includes integrated ransomware recovery as well as runbook-based recovery methods for failover and subsequent failback of entire enterprise data centers.

CIA Triad
---------

An abbreviation for the core tenets of information security: confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Confidentiality ensures that data is protected from unauthorized access, integrity maintains the accuracy and consistency of data, and availability ensures that data and systems are accessible when needed.

Every feature in VMware Cloud Foundation and VMware vSphere fits into one or more of these three categories, making every feature a security feature.

Clone
-----

An exact copy of a system, including its data, applications, and configuration settings. Cloning is often used for testing and deployment purposes, as it allows for the creation of identical systems or environments.

VMware Cloud Foundation and VMware vSphere allow cloning of virtual machines, both while running and while powered off. The clones are identical except for the unique identifiers each VM has, and the MAC addresses on the virtual network interfaces.

Cyber Resilience
