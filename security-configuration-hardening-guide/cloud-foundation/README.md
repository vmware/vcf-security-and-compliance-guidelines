# Cloud Foundation Security Configuration & Hardening

VMware, and now Broadcom, provides specific baseline guidance for hardening and auditing VMware products. Choose the version of the Security Configuration & Hardening Guide that is appropriate for your environment from the folder structure here.

Older versions of VMware Cloud Foundation hardening centered around regulatory compliance. To that end, please see the VCF Compliance Kits located at:

The vSphere and vSAN Security Configuration & Hardening Guides are also good references, and contain information about applying that guidance to VCF 5.2 and older installations. Please visit:
