AST-27,Network Access Control and Isolation,"VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) provides robust network access control and isolation capabilities, integrating vSphere, vSAN, and NSX to secure and manage network traffic effectively. Network access control is enforced through host- and appliance-based firewalling, identity and access management (IAM) systems, such as Active Directory integration, and role-based access control (RBAC) across NSX, vCenter Server, ESXi, and SDDC Manager, ensuring only authorized entities can access the network. For outbound connectivity, VCF leverages NSX edge gateways to configure proxies, routing and monitoring HTTP/HTTPS traffic through a reliable HTTP proxy to filter and control internet access, aligning with organizational security policies.

Network isolation in VCF begins with basic segmentation using vSphere’s VLANs and port groups, which logically separate traffic at Layer 2 to prevent unauthorized access between network segments. For traffic management, VCF employs Network I/O Control to prioritize and allocate bandwidth, ensuring critical applications maintain performance under load, while Avi Load Balancer provides Layer 4 and Layer 7 load balancing to distribute traffic efficiently across servers. These features, inherited from vSphere and enhanced through VCF’s integrated architecture, offer foundational isolation and performance optimization for workload domains.

For advanced security, VCF utilizes VMware NSX and vDefend for microsegmentation, enabling fine-grained control over traffic between virtual machines. NSX’s distributed firewall allows policies to be applied regardless of VM location, while vDefend, introduced in VCF 9, enhances this with distributed and gateway firewalls plus advanced threat prevention at the workload level.",,

Data-in-transit/network communications for system management are encrypted by default using these standardized cipher suites.

Data-in-transit protections which employ TLS have customizable PKI keypair and certificate options, ranging from fully automated within the platform, semi-automated using certificates and certificate authority roots issued from enterprise PKI infrastructure, or fully custom certificates installed manually. Automated certificate issuance is supported with Microsoft Active Directory Certificate Services.

Data-at-rest can be encrypted using vSAN Data-at-Rest encryption or VM Encryption on non-vSAN storage. Encryption keys for data-at-rest encryption can be stored within VCF or externally in a third-party KMS. Use of VM Encryption also encryptions data-in-transit for those VMs on the storage fabric. For vSAN there is a separate configurable data-in-transit encryption setting which can be enabled.

Data-in-use protections are supported via Intel SGX and AMD SEV-ES.

CLD-06,Isolation and Multitenancy,"Multitenancy is supported through vSphere’s ability to run each virtual machine (VM) in an isolated environment, preventing interference and ensuring data separation, which is foundational for hosting different tenants. Beyond the hypervisor, VCF enhances multitenancy with tools like vRealize Automation and vCloud Director, which enable the creation of separate management domains, policy-based access controls, and resource allocation per tenant. Additionally, vSphere Namespaces, part of vSphere with Tanzu, allow for fine-grained isolation of resources for containerized workloads.

Isolation inside the hypervisor is a key strength of VCF, driven by vSphere’s design to segregate VMs at the hardware level, with dedicated virtual CPU, memory, and storage for each. Network and storage isolation are further reinforced through virtual switches, port groups, and storage policies, ensuring that tenants’ traffic and data remain distinct. This isolation is critical for security in multitenant environments, and vSphere’s NIAP (National Information Assurance Partnership) certification validates its compliance with stringent security standards, such as those required for government use. While the certification specifically applies to vSphere, it underpins the hypervisor-level security that VCF relies on, offering assurance that tenant isolation is robust and trustworthy.",,

DCH-01,Network Access Control and Isolation,"VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) provides robust network access control and isolation capabilities, integrating vSphere, vSAN, and NSX to secure and manage network traffic effectively. Network access control is enforced through host- and appliance-based firewalling, identity and access management (IAM) systems, such as Active Directory integration, and role-based access control (RBAC) across NSX, vCenter Server, ESXi, and SDDC Manager, ensuring only authorized entities can access the network. For outbound connectivity, VCF leverages NSX edge gateways to configure proxies, routing and monitoring HTTP/HTTPS traffic through a reliable HTTP proxy to filter and control internet access, aligning with organizational security policies.

Network isolation in VCF begins with basic segmentation using vSphere’s VLANs and port groups, which logically separate traffic at Layer 2 to prevent unauthorized access between network segments. For traffic management, VCF employs Network I/O Control to prioritize and allocate bandwidth, ensuring critical applications maintain performance under load, while Avi Load Balancer provides Layer 4 and Layer 7 load balancing to distribute traffic efficiently across servers. These features, inherited from vSphere and enhanced through VCF’s integrated architecture, offer foundational isolation and performance optimization for workload domains.

For advanced security, VCF utilizes VMware NSX and vDefend for microsegmentation, enabling fine-grained control over traffic between virtual machines. NSX’s distributed firewall allows policies to be applied regardless of VM location, while vDefend, introduced in VCF 9, enhances this with distributed and gateway firewalls plus advanced threat prevention at the workload level.",,"Article 2, 1.

END-05,Network Access Control and Isolation,"VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) provides robust network access control and isolation capabilities, integrating vSphere, vSAN, and NSX to secure and manage network traffic effectively. Network access control is enforced through host- and appliance-based firewalling, identity and access management (IAM) systems, such as Active Directory integration, and role-based access control (RBAC) across NSX, vCenter Server, ESXi, and SDDC Manager, ensuring only authorized entities can access the network. For outbound connectivity, VCF leverages NSX edge gateways to configure proxies, routing and monitoring HTTP/HTTPS traffic through a reliable HTTP proxy to filter and control internet access, aligning with organizational security policies.

Network isolation in VCF begins with basic segmentation using vSphere’s VLANs and port groups, which logically separate traffic at Layer 2 to prevent unauthorized access between network segments. For traffic management, VCF employs Network I/O Control to prioritize and allocate bandwidth, ensuring critical applications maintain performance under load, while Avi Load Balancer provides Layer 4 and Layer 7 load balancing to distribute traffic efficiently across servers. These features, inherited from vSphere and enhanced through VCF’s integrated architecture, offer foundational isolation and performance optimization for workload domains.

For advanced security, VCF utilizes VMware NSX and vDefend for microsegmentation, enabling fine-grained control over traffic between virtual machines. NSX’s distributed firewall allows policies to be applied regardless of VM location, while vDefend, introduced in VCF 9, enhances this with distributed and gateway firewalls plus advanced threat prevention at the workload level.",,

END-16.1,Network Access Control and Isolation,"VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) provides robust network access control and isolation capabilities, integrating vSphere, vSAN, and NSX to secure and manage network traffic effectively. Network access control is enforced through host- and appliance-based firewalling, identity and access management (IAM) systems, such as Active Directory integration, and role-based access control (RBAC) across NSX, vCenter Server, ESXi, and SDDC Manager, ensuring only authorized entities can access the network. For outbound connectivity, VCF leverages NSX edge gateways to configure proxies, routing and monitoring HTTP/HTTPS traffic through a reliable HTTP proxy to filter and control internet access, aligning with organizational security policies.

Network isolation in VCF begins with basic segmentation using vSphere’s VLANs and port groups, which logically separate traffic at Layer 2 to prevent unauthorized access between network segments. For traffic management, VCF employs Network I/O Control to prioritize and allocate bandwidth, ensuring critical applications maintain performance under load, while Avi Load Balancer provides Layer 4 and Layer 7 load balancing to distribute traffic efficiently across servers. These features, inherited from vSphere and enhanced through VCF’s integrated architecture, offer foundational isolation and performance optimization for workload domains.

For advanced security, VCF utilizes VMware NSX and vDefend for microsegmentation, enabling fine-grained control over traffic between virtual machines. NSX’s distributed firewall allows policies to be applied regardless of VM location, while vDefend, introduced in VCF 9, enhances this with distributed and gateway firewalls plus advanced threat prevention at the workload level.",,

Data-in-transit/network communications for system management are encrypted by default using these standardized cipher suites.

Data-in-transit protections which employ TLS have customizable PKI keypair and certificate options, ranging from fully automated within the platform, semi-automated using certificates and certificate authority roots issued from enterprise PKI infrastructure, or fully custom certificates installed manually. Automated certificate issuance is supported with Microsoft Active Directory Certificate Services.

Data-at-rest can be encrypted using vSAN Data-at-Rest encryption or VM Encryption on non-vSAN storage. Encryption keys for data-at-rest encryption can be stored within VCF or externally in a third-party KMS. Use of VM Encryption also encryptions data-in-transit for those VMs on the storage fabric. For vSAN there is a separate configurable data-in-transit encryption setting which can be enabled.

Data-in-use protections are supported via Intel SGX and AMD SEV-ES.

Note that data-at-rest protections do not extend to ESX boot volumes, where log and system configuration data may reside. Use of self-encrypting drives and/or other data destruction techniques may be a compensating control.",,

IAC-10.2,Cryptography and Encryption,"VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) supports modern cryptographic standards, like TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3, as well as formal validation of cryptographic libraries via FIPS 140-2 and 140-3. Data-in-transit/network communications for system management are encrypted by default using these standardized cipher suites.

Data-in-transit protections which employ TLS have customizable PKI keypair and certificate options, ranging from fully automated within the platform, semi-automated using certificates and certificate authority roots issued from enterprise PKI infrastructure, or fully custom certificates installed manually. Automated certificate issuance is supported with Microsoft Active Directory Certificate Services.

Data-at-rest can be encrypted using vSAN Data-at-Rest encryption or VM Encryption on non-vSAN storage. Encryption keys for data-at-rest encryption can be stored within VCF or externally in a third-party KMS. Use of VM Encryption also encryptions data-in-transit for those VMs on the storage fabric. For vSAN there is a separate configurable data-in-transit encryption setting which can be enabled.

Data-in-use protections are supported via Intel SGX and AMD SEV-ES.

Note that data-at-rest protections do not extend to ESX boot volumes, where log and system configuration data may reside. Use of self-encrypting drives and/or other data destruction techniques may be a compensating control.",,

Data-in-transit/network communications for system management are encrypted by default using these standardized cipher suites.

Data-in-transit protections which employ TLS have customizable PKI keypair and certificate options, ranging from fully automated within the platform, semi-automated using certificates and certificate authority roots issued from enterprise PKI infrastructure, or fully custom certificates installed manually. Automated certificate issuance is supported with Microsoft Active Directory Certificate Services.

Data-at-rest can be encrypted using vSAN Data-at-Rest encryption or VM Encryption on non-vSAN storage. Encryption keys for data-at-rest encryption can be stored within VCF or externally in a third-party KMS. Use of VM Encryption also encryptions data-in-transit for those VMs on the storage fabric. For vSAN there is a separate configurable data-in-transit encryption setting which can be enabled.

Data-in-use protections are supported via Intel SGX and AMD SEV-ES.

SDDC Manager automates Workload Domain management, organizing resources into logical containers for scalability and efficiency.

Quality of Service (QoS) in VCF is ensured by NSX’s network traffic prioritization (CoS, DSCP) and vSphere’s Storage I/O Control, which optimizes storage access for critical workloads. vSAN Storage Policies further refine performance and availability, delivering tailored QoS for diverse VM needs.

NET-02.2,Network Access Control and Isolation,"VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) provides robust network access control and isolation capabilities, integrating vSphere, vSAN, and NSX to secure and manage network traffic effectively. Network access control is enforced through host- and appliance-based firewalling, identity and access management (IAM) systems, such as Active Directory integration, and role-based access control (RBAC) across NSX, vCenter Server, ESXi, and SDDC Manager, ensuring only authorized entities can access the network. For outbound connectivity, VCF leverages NSX edge gateways to configure proxies, routing and monitoring HTTP/HTTPS traffic through a reliable HTTP proxy to filter and control internet access, aligning with organizational security policies.

Network isolation in VCF begins with basic segmentation using vSphere’s VLANs and port groups, which logically separate traffic at Layer 2 to prevent unauthorized access between network segments. For traffic management, VCF employs Network I/O Control to prioritize and allocate bandwidth, ensuring critical applications maintain performance under load, while Avi Load Balancer provides Layer 4 and Layer 7 load balancing to distribute traffic efficiently across servers. These features, inherited from vSphere and enhanced through VCF’s integrated architecture, offer foundational isolation and performance optimization for workload domains.

For advanced security, VCF utilizes VMware NSX and vDefend for microsegmentation, enabling fine-grained control over traffic between virtual machines. NSX’s distributed firewall allows policies to be applied regardless of VM location, while vDefend, introduced in VCF 9, enhances this with distributed and gateway firewalls plus advanced threat prevention at the workload level.",,

NET-06,Network Access Control and Isolation,"VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) provides robust network access control and isolation capabilities, integrating vSphere, vSAN, and NSX to secure and manage network traffic effectively. Network access control is enforced through host- and appliance-based firewalling, identity and access management (IAM) systems, such as Active Directory integration, and role-based access control (RBAC) across NSX, vCenter Server, ESXi, and SDDC Manager, ensuring only authorized entities can access the network. For outbound connectivity, VCF leverages NSX edge gateways to configure proxies, routing and monitoring HTTP/HTTPS traffic through a reliable HTTP proxy to filter and control internet access, aligning with organizational security policies.

Network isolation in VCF begins with basic segmentation using vSphere’s VLANs and port groups, which logically separate traffic at Layer 2 to prevent unauthorized access between network segments. For traffic management, VCF employs Network I/O Control to prioritize and allocate bandwidth, ensuring critical applications maintain performance under load, while Avi Load Balancer provides Layer 4 and Layer 7 load balancing to distribute traffic efficiently across servers. These features, inherited from vSphere and enhanced through VCF’s integrated architecture, offer foundational isolation and performance optimization for workload domains.

For advanced security, VCF utilizes VMware NSX and vDefend for microsegmentation, enabling fine-grained control over traffic between virtual machines. NSX’s distributed firewall allows policies to be applied regardless of VM location, while vDefend, introduced in VCF 9, enhances this with distributed and gateway firewalls plus advanced threat prevention at the workload level.",,"Article 13(a)

TDA-07,Network Access Control and Isolation,"VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) provides robust network access control and isolation capabilities, integrating vSphere, vSAN, and NSX to secure and manage network traffic effectively. Network access control is enforced through host- and appliance-based firewalling, identity and access management (IAM) systems, such as Active Directory integration, and role-based access control (RBAC) across NSX, vCenter Server, ESXi, and SDDC Manager, ensuring only authorized entities can access the network. For outbound connectivity, VCF leverages NSX edge gateways to configure proxies, routing and monitoring HTTP/HTTPS traffic through a reliable HTTP proxy to filter and control internet access, aligning with organizational security policies.

Network isolation in VCF begins with basic segmentation using vSphere’s VLANs and port groups, which logically separate traffic at Layer 2 to prevent unauthorized access between network segments. For traffic management, VCF employs Network I/O Control to prioritize and allocate bandwidth, ensuring critical applications maintain performance under load, while Avi Load Balancer provides Layer 4 and Layer 7 load balancing to distribute traffic efficiently across servers. These features, inherited from vSphere and enhanced through VCF’s integrated architecture, offer foundational isolation and performance optimization for workload domains.

For advanced security, VCF utilizes VMware NSX and vDefend for microsegmentation, enabling fine-grained control over traffic between virtual machines. NSX’s distributed firewall allows policies to be applied regardless of VM location, while vDefend, introduced in VCF 9, enhances this with distributed and gateway firewalls plus advanced threat prevention at the workload level.",Not Applicable,

TPM-04.2,Isolation and Multitenancy,"Multitenancy is supported through vSphere’s ability to run each virtual machine (VM) in an isolated environment, preventing interference and ensuring data separation, which is foundational for hosting different tenants. Beyond the hypervisor, VCF enhances multitenancy with tools like vRealize Automation and vCloud Director, which enable the creation of separate management domains, policy-based access controls, and resource allocation per tenant. Additionally, vSphere Namespaces, part of vSphere with Tanzu, allow for fine-grained isolation of resources for containerized workloads.

Isolation inside the hypervisor is a key strength of VCF, driven by vSphere’s design to segregate VMs at the hardware level, with dedicated virtual CPU, memory, and storage for each. Network and storage isolation are further reinforced through virtual switches, port groups, and storage policies, ensuring that tenants’ traffic and data remain distinct. This isolation is critical for security in multitenant environments, and vSphere’s NIAP (National Information Assurance Partnership) certification validates its compliance with stringent security standards, such as those required for government use. While the certification specifically applies to vSphere, it underpins the hypervisor-level security that VCF relies on, offering assurance that tenant isolation is robust and trustworthy.",Not Applicable,

WEB-02,Network Access Control and Isolation,"VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) provides robust network access control and isolation capabilities, integrating vSphere, vSAN, and NSX to secure and manage network traffic effectively. Network access control is enforced through host- and appliance-based firewalling, identity and access management (IAM) systems, such as Active Directory integration, and role-based access control (RBAC) across NSX, vCenter Server, ESXi, and SDDC Manager, ensuring only authorized entities can access the network. For outbound connectivity, VCF leverages NSX edge gateways to configure proxies, routing and monitoring HTTP/HTTPS traffic through a reliable HTTP proxy to filter and control internet access, aligning with organizational security policies.

Network isolation in VCF begins with basic segmentation using vSphere’s VLANs and port groups, which logically separate traffic at Layer 2 to prevent unauthorized access between network segments. For traffic management, VCF employs Network I/O Control to prioritize and allocate bandwidth, ensuring critical applications maintain performance under load, while Avi Load Balancer provides Layer 4 and Layer 7 load balancing to distribute traffic efficiently across servers. These features, inherited from vSphere and enhanced through VCF’s integrated architecture, offer foundational isolation and performance optimization for workload domains.

For advanced security, VCF utilizes VMware NSX and vDefend for microsegmentation, enabling fine-grained control over traffic between virtual machines. NSX’s distributed firewall allows policies to be applied regardless of VM location, while vDefend, introduced in VCF 9, enhances this with distributed and gateway firewalls plus advanced threat prevention at the workload level.",Not Applicable,

WEB-10,Cryptography and Encryption,"VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) supports modern cryptographic standards, like TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3, as well as formal validation of cryptographic libraries via FIPS 140-2 and 140-3. Data-in-transit/network communications for system management are encrypted by default using these standardized cipher suites.

Data-in-transit protections which employ TLS have customizable PKI keypair and certificate options, ranging from fully automated within the platform, semi-automated using certificates and certificate authority roots issued from enterprise PKI infrastructure, or fully custom certificates installed manually. Automated certificate issuance is supported with Microsoft Active Directory Certificate Services.

Data-at-rest can be encrypted using vSAN Data-at-Rest encryption or VM Encryption on non-vSAN storage. Encryption keys for data-at-rest encryption can be stored within VCF or externally in a third-party KMS. Use of VM Encryption also encryptions data-in-transit for those VMs on the storage fabric. For vSAN there is a separate configurable data-in-transit encryption setting which can be enabled.

Data-in-use protections are supported via Intel SGX and AMD SEV-ES.

Note that data-at-rest protections do not extend to ESX boot volumes, where log and system configuration data may reside. Use of self-encrypting drives and/or other data destruction techniques may be a compensating control.",,
