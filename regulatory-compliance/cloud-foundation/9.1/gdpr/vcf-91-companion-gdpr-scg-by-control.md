# Companion Guide to Regulation (EU) 2016/679 General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for VMware Cloud Foundation 9.1 -- Framework Controls by SCG Coverage

## Version

910-20260623-01

## About This Dataset

This dataset is derived mechanically from the VMware Cloud Foundation Security Configuration Guide 9.1 and the Secure Controls Framework (SCF) 2026.1 crosswalk. Each SCG hardening control carries one or more SCF control identifiers; a control is treated as relevant to this framework when one of its SCF identifiers maps to a control of this framework in the SCF crosswalk. The SCG describes platform hardening settings, so frameworks built around technical configuration map to many SCG controls while frameworks built around organizational process map to few.

Most regulatory and compliance frameworks are satisfied through a combination of product capabilities and organizational process, not through technical configuration alone. The Security Configuration Guide covers the platform's technical hardening settings, so this crosswalk shows only that slice of how a framework is addressed. A short list of mapped controls usually means the framework is largely organizational, not that the platform offers little toward it; the relevant product capabilities are described elsewhere. For the fuller picture of how the assessed products support this framework, including capabilities that are not expressed as hardening settings, consult the companion guide for this framework and the other guidance at https://brcm.tech/vcf-security.

## Third Party Identifiers and Mappings

This document includes regulatory compliance and security control identifiers from external sources as a convenience to end users. This does not constitute endorsement, in either direction.

There is not a one-to-one mapping of product capabilities to third-party controls. A product capability, or set of capabilities, may be applicable to multiple controls. Conversely, a control may be satisfied with the use of multiple capabilities.

## Framework Controls With Relevant SCG Hardening Controls

1 framework controls have at least one Security Configuration Guide hardening control mapped to them through the SCF crosswalk.

### Control 32.1(a)

> Taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing as well as the risk of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller and the processor shall implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including inter alia as appropriate: a. the pseudonymisation and encryption of personal data; 

**Bridging SCF Controls:** CRY-01

**Relevant SCG Controls:**

- esx-9.entropy -- The ESX host must use sufficient entropy for cryptographic operations.
- esx-9.hardware-cpu-amd-cc -- Enable AMD SEV-ES and SEV-SNP in system firmware where available, and size the SEV ASID pool appropriately.
- esx-9.hardware-cpu-intel-cc -- Enable Intel SGX and TDX in system firmware where available.
- nsx-9.load-balancer-fips -- Enable FIPS-validated cryptography for NSX load balancers.
- vcenter-9.snmp3 -- Enforce SNMPv3 authentication and privacy where SNMP is enabled on vCenter.
