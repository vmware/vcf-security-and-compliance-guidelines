# NIST Generative AI Profile (NIST AI 600-1)

The **NIST Generative Artificial Intelligence Profile**, published as NIST AI 600-1, is a cross-sectoral profile of the NIST AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF 1.0). It identifies risks that are unique to or exacerbated by generative AI, such as confabulation, information integrity, data privacy, and intellectual property risks, and suggests actions for managing them. The suggested actions are organized under the AI RMF functions, categories, and subcategories.

## Using These Materials

XLSX, CSV, Markdown, and PDF formats are provided as a convenience for people working with this data on a daily basis. The XLSX contains an Introduction sheet and a Controls sheet; the CSV carries the Controls data alone; the Markdown file combines both in a readable single document with one heading per control; the PDF is a print-formatted rendering of the Markdown document. Each control row carries the following columns:

- **Control ID** -- the regulatory framework's control identifier.
- **SCF ID** -- the mapping to the Secure Controls Framework (SCF) control or controls, where one exists.
- **Description** -- the regulatory framework control's text, included here for reference.
- **Aggregate Coverage** -- the strongest position any one of the assessed products holds for that control. See below for definitions.
- **A Coverage and a Response column per assessed product** -- VMware Cloud Foundation (abbreviated VCF in the column headers), VMware vDefend, VCF Protection and Recovery, VMware Data Services Manager, and VMware Avi Load Balancer. The Coverage column holds that product's own coverage level; the Response column describes how the product meets or can help meet the requirements in the control.

This guide covers VMware Cloud Foundation 9.1 and the separately licensed advanced services assessed alongside it. The VCF columns cover the full platform, including its consumption services and Private AI Services capabilities. No single product addresses a control in full; the per-product columns make the division of responsibility explicit. A product that does not apply to a given control carries a brief out-of-scope statement in place of a response.

### Coverage Values

- **Meets** -- the product directly provides the capability described in the control. No additional organizational process, external product, or human activity is needed beyond configuring the product itself.
- **Contributes** -- the product provides technical capabilities that help satisfy the control, but the control also requires something outside the product to be fully met, such as an organizational process, human activity, or an additional tool.
- **Not Applicable** -- the control does not apply to the product. Physical facility controls, staffing decisions, organizational governance processes, and domains the product does not operate in fall here.
- **Not Supported** -- the control is relevant to the product's domain (infrastructure, networking, security), but the product lacks the specific capability the control requires.
- **Not Assessed** -- the control has not yet been evaluated against the product.
