# Companion Guide to UK Cyber Essentials for VMware Cloud Foundation 9.1 -- Framework Controls by SCG Coverage

## Version

910-20260623-01

## About This Dataset

This dataset is derived mechanically from the VMware Cloud Foundation Security Configuration Guide 9.1 and the Secure Controls Framework (SCF) 2026.1 crosswalk. Each SCG hardening control carries one or more SCF control identifiers; a control is treated as relevant to this framework when one of its SCF identifiers maps to a control of this framework in the SCF crosswalk. The SCG describes platform hardening settings, so frameworks built around technical configuration map to many SCG controls while frameworks built around organizational process map to few.

Most regulatory and compliance frameworks are satisfied through a combination of product capabilities and organizational process, not through technical configuration alone. The Security Configuration Guide covers the platform's technical hardening settings, so this crosswalk shows only that slice of how a framework is addressed. A short list of mapped controls usually means the framework is largely organizational, not that the platform offers little toward it; the relevant product capabilities are described elsewhere. For the fuller picture of how the assessed products support this framework, including capabilities that are not expressed as hardening settings, consult the companion guide for this framework and the other guidance at https://brcm.tech/vcf-security.

## Third Party Identifiers and Mappings

This document includes regulatory compliance and security control identifiers from external sources as a convenience to end users. This does not constitute endorsement, in either direction.

There is not a one-to-one mapping of product capabilities to third-party controls. A product capability, or set of capabilities, may be applicable to multiple controls. Conversely, a control may be satisfied with the use of multiple capabilities.

## Framework Controls With Relevant SCG Hardening Controls

4 framework controls have at least one Security Configuration Guide hardening control mapped to them through the SCF crosswalk.

### Control 1

> Firewalls: To make sure that only secure and necessary network services can be accessed from the internet.

**Bridging SCF Controls:** END-05, NET-03

**Relevant SCG Controls:**

- esx-9.firewall-restrict-access -- Configure the ESX host firewall to only allow traffic from authorized networks.
- nsx-9.ibgp-source-loopback -- Configure Tier-0 Gateway iBGP peering to use the loopback address as the source.
- nsx-9.reverse-path-forwarding -- NSX Tier-0 Gateway must enable unicast Reverse Path Forwarding to drop spoofed-source packets.
- operations-9.firewall-hardening -- VCF Operations must enable firewall hardening.
- vcenter-9.network-mac-learning -- Disable MAC learning on distributed switch port groups unless a workload requires it.
- vcenter-9.network-reject-forged-transmit-dvportgroup -- Reject forged transmits on distributed switches and port groups.
- vcenter-9.network-reject-mac-changes-dvportgroup -- Reject guest MAC address changes on distributed switches and port groups.
- vcenter-9.network-reset-port -- Reset distributed switch port configuration when a virtual machine disconnects.
- vcenter-9.network-restrict-netflow-usage -- Send distributed switch NetFlow data only to authorized collectors.
- vcenter-9.network-restrict-port-level-overrides -- Disallow per-port policy overrides on distributed port groups, except port blocking.
- vcenter-9.network-restrict-port-mirroring -- Remove unauthorized port mirroring sessions on distributed switches.
- vcenter-9.vami-firewall-restrict-access -- Configure the vCenter appliance firewall to allow inbound traffic only from authorized networks.
- vsan-9.hcl-internet -- Disable or proxy the vSAN Health Check Hardware Compatibility List (HCL) download.
- vsan-9.network-isolation-vsan-iscsi-target -- Isolate vSAN iSCSI Target traffic on dedicated VMkernel interfaces.

### Control 2

> Secure configuration: Ensure that computers and network devices are properly configured to reduce vulnerabilities and provide only the services required to fulfil their role.

**Bridging SCF Controls:** CFG-02, IAC-02, IAC-10

**Relevant SCG Controls:**

- automation-9.oidc-settings -- Bound VCF Automation OIDC token lifetimes and keep redirect targets HTTPS-only.
- automation-9.timeouts -- Limit the VCF Automation API token lifetime.
- fleet-9.access-token -- Limit the maximum lifetime of access tokens.
- fleet-9.api-token -- Limit the maximum lifetime of API tokens.
- sddc-9.basic-auth-disable -- Disable HTTP Basic Authentication on the SDDC Manager API.
- vcf-9.mfa -- Integrate VMware Cloud Foundation with an identity provider that enforces multifactor authentication.
- vcf-9.secure-baseline -- Apply the controls in this guidance, and document the rationale for any deviations.

### Control 3

> Security update management: Ensure that devices and software are not vulnerable to known security issues for which fixes are available.

**Bridging SCF Controls:** IAC-07

**Relevant SCG Controls:**

- operations-9.non-imported-vidm -- Restrict VCF Operations access to imported identity-provider users.

### Control 5

> Malware protection: To restrict execution of known malware and untrusted software, from causing damage or accessing data.

**Bridging SCF Controls:** VPM-05

**Relevant SCG Controls:**

- esx-9.hardware-firmware-updates -- Ensure all system and device firmware is auditable, authentic, and up to date.
- esx-9.updates -- The ESX host must have all available software updates and patches installed.
- guest-9.tools-updates -- The guest OS must run a current version of VMware Tools.
- guest-9.tools-upgrade -- The guest OS must enable VMware Tools auto-upgrade, or use an equivalent external update path.
- vcenter-9.vami-updates -- vCenter must have all available software updates and patches installed.
