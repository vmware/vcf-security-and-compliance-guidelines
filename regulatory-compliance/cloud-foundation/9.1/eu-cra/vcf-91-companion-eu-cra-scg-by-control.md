# Companion Guide to Regulation (EU) 2024/2847 Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) for VMware Cloud Foundation 9.1 -- Framework Controls by SCG Coverage

## Version

910-20260623-01

## About This Dataset

This dataset is derived mechanically from the VMware Cloud Foundation Security Configuration Guide 9.1 and the Secure Controls Framework (SCF) 2026.1 crosswalk. Each SCG hardening control carries one or more SCF control identifiers; a control is treated as relevant to this framework when one of its SCF identifiers maps to a control of this framework in the SCF crosswalk. The SCG describes platform hardening settings, so frameworks built around technical configuration map to many SCG controls while frameworks built around organizational process map to few.

Most regulatory and compliance frameworks are satisfied through a combination of product capabilities and organizational process, not through technical configuration alone. The Security Configuration Guide covers the platform's technical hardening settings, so this crosswalk shows only that slice of how a framework is addressed. A short list of mapped controls usually means the framework is largely organizational, not that the platform offers little toward it; the relevant product capabilities are described elsewhere. For the fuller picture of how the assessed products support this framework, including capabilities that are not expressed as hardening settings, consult the companion guide for this framework and the other guidance at https://brcm.tech/vcf-security.

## Third Party Identifiers and Mappings

This document includes regulatory compliance and security control identifiers from external sources as a convenience to end users. This does not constitute endorsement, in either direction.

There is not a one-to-one mapping of product capabilities to third-party controls. A product capability, or set of capabilities, may be applicable to multiple controls. Conversely, a control may be satisfied with the use of multiple capabilities.

Control identifier numbers have been included from the Secure Controls Framework, version 2026.1, under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NoDerivatives 4.0 International Public License. No modifications have been made to the control identifier numbers under the terms of the license.

## Framework Controls With Relevant SCG Hardening Controls

2 framework controls have at least one Security Configuration Guide hardening control mapped to them through the SCF crosswalk.

### Control 13.5

> For the purpose of complying with paragraph 1, manufacturers shall exercise due diligence when integrating components sourced from third parties so that those components do not compromise the cybersecurity of the product with digital elements, including when integrating components of free and open-source software that have not been made available on the market in the course of a commercial activity.

**Bridging SCF Controls:** TPM-03

**Relevant SCG Controls:**

- vcenter-9.administration-client-plugins -- Reduce or eliminate third-party vCenter plugins.

### Control Annex I Part I (2)(g)

> process only data, personal or other, that are adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the intended purpose of the product with digital elements (data minimisation);

**Bridging SCF Controls:** IAC-21

**Relevant SCG Controls:**

- esx-9.ad-admin-group-autoadd -- The ESX host must not automatically grant administrative permissions to Active Directory groups.
- esx-9.lockdown-dcui-access -- Maintain the DCUI.Access list for administrative recovery if Lockdown Mode isolates the host.
- esx-9.lockdown-exception-users -- Keep the Lockdown Mode Exception Users list to the minimum necessary.
- vcf-9.permissions-roles -- Review and right-size accounts, permissions, and role assignments across all VCF components.
- vm-9.isolation-device-connectable-deactivate -- Virtual machines must prevent unauthorized removal, connection, and modification of devices.
- vm-9.pci-passthrough -- Virtual machines must limit PCI device passthrough functionality.
