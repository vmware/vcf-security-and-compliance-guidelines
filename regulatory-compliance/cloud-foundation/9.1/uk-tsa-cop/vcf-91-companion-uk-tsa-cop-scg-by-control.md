# Companion Guide to the UK Telecommunications Security Code of Practice for VMware Cloud Foundation 9.1 -- Framework Controls by SCG Coverage

## Version

910-20260623-01

## About This Dataset

This dataset is derived mechanically from the VMware Cloud Foundation Security Configuration Guide 9.1 and the Secure Controls Framework (SCF) 2026.1 crosswalk. Each SCG hardening control carries one or more SCF control identifiers; a control is treated as relevant to this framework when one of its SCF identifiers maps to a control of this framework in the SCF crosswalk. The SCG describes platform hardening settings, so frameworks built around technical configuration map to many SCG controls while frameworks built around organizational process map to few.

Most regulatory and compliance frameworks are satisfied through a combination of product capabilities and organizational process, not through technical configuration alone. The Security Configuration Guide covers the platform's technical hardening settings, so this crosswalk shows only that slice of how a framework is addressed. A short list of mapped controls usually means the framework is largely organizational, not that the platform offers little toward it; the relevant product capabilities are described elsewhere. For the fuller picture of how the assessed products support this framework, including capabilities that are not expressed as hardening settings, consult the companion guide for this framework and the other guidance at https://brcm.tech/vcf-security.

There is not a one-to-one mapping of product capabilities to third-party controls. A product capability, or set of capabilities, may be applicable to multiple controls. Conversely, a control may be satisfied with the use of multiple capabilities.
