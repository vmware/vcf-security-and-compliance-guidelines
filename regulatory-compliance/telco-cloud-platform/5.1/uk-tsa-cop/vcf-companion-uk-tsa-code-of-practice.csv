M1.01,"AST-02, NET-03",Providers shall maintain accurate records of all externally-facing systems.,"3(3)(c),(d),(e); 3(4); 3(5); 4(4)(b); 6(4); 8(3)","VCF/TCP provides API integration support for third-party tools including IT asset management (ITAM) systems, configuration management databases (CMDB), and security assessment tools. The VCF Operations suite, which includes VCF Operations for Networks, VCF Operations for Logs, and VCF Operations, works with VMware vDefend to deliver security assessment and continuous monitoring. VCF Operations for Networks specifically discovers and maps all externally-facing systems and their traffic flows, providing a real-time view of the infrastructure and its dependencies. Security teams can generate custom reports, export data, and automate tasks using product interfaces, PowerCLI, and APIs. VCF/TCP supports VMware APIs for Data Protection (VADP) for third-party backup integration.",Contributes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
M1.02,"VPM-07, IAO-02","Security testing on externally-facing systems, excluding CPE, should normally be performed at least every two years, and in any case shortly after a significant change occurs.","3(3)(a)(iv); 3(3)(c),(d),(e); 3(5); 4(4)(b); 8(3); 14","While the formal process of security testing is an organizational responsibility, VCF/TCP provides integrated tools to support this requirement. The VMware vDefend Distributed Firewall includes an Intrusion Detection System/Intrusion Prevention System (IDS/IPS) that performs continuous assessment of externally-facing systems. This engine uses signature-based detection to identify known attack patterns and anomaly-based detection to identify suspicious activity that could indicate an unknown or zero-day threat. This provides a continuous, automated layer of security testing in addition to periodic manual assessments.",Contributes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
M1.03,"NET-08.1, NET-06.3, NET-03.7",Equipment in the exposed edge shall not host sensitive data or security critical functions.,"3(3)(a),(d); 3(5); 4(1)(a),(b); 4(2)(a),(b); 4(4)(b)","This is primarily an architectural and organizational policy that VCF/TCP directly enables. VCF/TCP's Workload Domain architecture allows providers to create logically and often physically separate infrastructure pools. A provider would deploy their ""exposed edge"" services into a dedicated Edge Workload Domain, while ensuring that ""security critical functions"" (like vCenter, NSX Manager, and VCF Operations) reside in the separate, highly secured Management Domain. VMware vDefend and NSX then enforce strict, ""default-deny"" firewall policies to isolate the Management Domain, preventing the edge from accessing or hosting sensitive data and functions.",Contributes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
M1.04,"NET-06, NET-03.7",Physical and logical separation shall be implemented between the exposed edge and security critical functions. Note that this measure may not be necessary once datasets and functions can be cryptographically-protected from compromise.,"3(3)(c),(d),(e); 3(5); 4(4)(b)","VCF/TCP achieves this separation using a multi-layered approach. Logical separation is enforced by the VMware vDefend Distributed Firewall, which applies distributed, stateful firewalling and zero-trust policies to isolate the exposed edge from critical functions, regardless of their physical location. Physical separation is enabled through the Workload Domain architecture. Providers can deploy critical functions (like the VCF Management Domain) on a dedicated cluster of hosts, while edge services run on a separate physical cluster, ensuring no shared hardware or ""blast radius.""",Contributes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
M1.05,"NET-03, NET-03.7",Security boundaries shall exist between the exposed edge and critical or sensitive functions that implement protective measures.,"3(3)(c),(d); 3(5); 4(4)(b)","VCF/TCP establishes robust security boundaries using VMware vDefend and NSX Edge Gateways. The vDefend Gateway Firewall acts as the primary North-South security boundary, providing stateful inspection, NAT, and VPN capabilities. Behind this, the VMware vDefend Distributed Firewall (DFW) provides granular, east-west firewalling, creating a ""default-deny"" internal security boundary that isolates every workload. This ensures that even if the edge is compromised, lateral movement to critical functions is blocked by this internal boundary.",Contributes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
M1.06,"NET-06, NET-03.7","Equipment in the exposed edge shall not be able to impact operation or routing within the core network. As an example, the exposed edge shall not be a PE-node within the provider's IP Core.","3(3)(c),(d); 3(5); 4(4)(b)","This is an architectural principle that VCF/TCP's networking model supports. The ""exposed edge"" services (e.g., customer-facing VMs or CNFs) run as workloads on the VCF/TCP; they are not VCF/TCP's routing infrastructure itself. VCF/TCP's core network routing is managed by NSX Edge Nodes, which act as the provider's PE-nodes (or connect to them). These Edge Nodes are part of the secured infrastructure, logically separate from the workloads. By using vDefend firewall rules, the provider can ensure that workloads in the exposed edge domain cannot access or interact with the management interfaces of the NSX Edge Nodes, preventing them from impacting core network routing.",Contributes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The requirement to change passwords upon initialization is enforced as a mandatory step in the deployment process. When you deploy VCF/TCP or its components, you must either specify a strong, unique password for each component account or have the system auto-generate a complex, random password. No default credentials are left on the device after this initial setup. After deployment, these passwords can be centrally managed, rotated, and remediated via the VCF Operations console. Password policies, such as complexity, history, and timeouts, are enforced by VCF SSO or can be federated to an external identity provider.",Meets,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The VCF Operations Audit Events framework captures VCF/TCP interactions including user logins and logouts, capability checks, and configuration modifications across vSphere, vSAN, and NSX resources. This framework enhances transparency, control, and accountability by registering each action as an event. It enables detection of suspicious access patterns and policy violations while providing user accountability through detailed activity tracking.

ESX hosts maintain local logging with configurable retention and rotation policies for forensic purposes. vCenter Server provides database retention policies with automated cleanup based on age or database size. API audit logging captures REST API calls, SDK usage, and PowerCLI commands with user attribution. Storage operation logging tracks vSAN operations, datastore actions, and storage policy changes. NSX-T maintains audit trails for all network configuration changes including firewall rules, segments, and routing modifications.

Platform allows configuration of syslog to forward logs to up to three syslog forwarding targets using various protocols. Log forwarding supports TLS encryption to ensure confidentiality in transit. VCF Operations for Logs provides centralized log retention policies configurable by log type, source, and compliance requirements. Certificate lifecycle events including generation, renewal, revocation, and expiration are logged for security tracking. Time synchronization audit captures NTP events and drift corrections for forensic accuracy.

vSphere High Availability (HA) maintains detailed logs of all failover operations, host isolation events, and admission control decisions for audit trail purposes. VMware Live Site Recovery maintains detailed logs of all recovery operations, protection group changes, and recovery plan executions.

Kubernetes audit logging captures all API calls to the vSphere Supervisor. This includes namespace operations, pod deployments, and role-based access control (RBAC) changes.

M19.02,"IAC-04.1, CFG-02",Only physical hosts that have cryptographically attested to be in a known-good state can be provisioned into the virtualisation fabric.,"3(1)(a),(b),(c); 3(3)(d),(e); 3(5); 4(1)(a),(b); 4(2)(a),(b); 4(4)(b); 8(3); 8(4); 12","VCF/TCP addresses this with controls at both provision-time and run-time. For provisioning, it ensures only known and trusted hosts are added using privileged access control and a mandatory, auditable manual verification step. Adding a new ESX host to the fabric must be initiated from VCF Operations and vCenter by an authorized administrator. During this process, vCenter establishes a secure connection to the host and presents the host's SHA-256 certificate thumbprint. The administrator is required to manually verify this thumbprint against the one displayed on the host's console (DCUI). This human-in-the-loop verification is the critical control that prevents spoofed or ""unknown"" hosts from being provisioned.

Once provisioned, hosts that employ a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) provide continuous cryptographic attestation of their known-good state. The TPM enables Secure Boot, which includes code signing and continuous verification of code integrity for the hypervisor and its components. These hardware-rooted integrity checks cannot be disabled, providing a persistent assurance that the host is running a known-good, unaltered state and protecting it from boot-level and hypervisor-level malware.",Contributes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
M19.03,"IAC-27, NET-03.7","Where the virtualisation fabric allows virtual functions to have direct access to the physical hardware (cut-throughs), it shall not be treated as a security boundary.","3(1)(a),(b),(c); 3(3)(d),(e); 4(1)(a),(b); 4(2)(a),(b)","VCF/TCP supports hardware passthrough via VMware DirectPath I/O and Single Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV) for high-performance workloads. These ""cut-through"" mechanisms bypass the hypervisor networking stack, mapping I/O directly from the guest OS to the physical hardware.

A direct consequence is that hypervisor-level security services, such as the VMware vDefend Distributed Firewall (DFW), cannot inspect or enforce policy on this traffic. The DFW operates at the virtual NIC (vNIC) level, which is bypassed by these passthrough methods.

In accordance with this measure, VCF/TCP acknowledges that when passthrough is utilized, the hypervisor fabric cannot be treated as the security boundary for that I/o path. Security enforcement must be relocated to an external device, such as the upstream physical switch, treating the workload as a bare-metal equivalent from a network security perspective.",Contributes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The initial build is driven by VCF Operations using a standardized, automated workflow. For ongoing updates, vSphere Lifecycle Manager (vLCM), orchestrated by VCF Operations, uses a desired-state approach.

An administrator defines a single vLCM host image that specifies the exact software, drivers, and firmware for all ESX hosts in a cluster. vLCM then continuously checks the cluster for compliance against this image and can provide automated remediation to correct any drift. This verifiable, desired-state model ensures the fabric is built and updated in a consistent, automated, and auditable manner.",Contributes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The VCF Operations suite includes VCF Operations, VCF Operations for Logs, and VCF Operations for Networks. VCF/TCP combines signature-based intrusion detection with behavioral analysis for advanced threat detection. Real-time system alerts flag security misconfigurations, configuration changes, and potential threats across the infrastructure stack. This includes policy violations, log data anomalies, and system health violations such as vSAN storage alerts.

vCenter Server provides a comprehensive events and alarms framework that captures thousands of event types across hosts, virtual machines (VMs), storage, and networking components. Administrators can create customizable alarm definitions with automated responses to security events, threshold violations, and system state changes. This native vSphere eventing system forms the foundation for real-time security monitoring and incident response.

The VCF Operations Audit Events framework captures VCF/TCP interactions including user logins and logouts, capability checks, and configuration modifications across vSphere, vSAN, and NSX resources. This framework enhances transparency, control, and accountability by registering each action as an event. It enables detection of suspicious access patterns and policy violations while providing user accountability through detailed activity tracking. Resource access control auditing tracks permission changes, role assignments, and access control modifications throughout the infrastructure, ensuring all privilege escalations and delegations are recorded.

ESX hosts generate detailed audit logs capturing security-relevant events including authentication attempts, configuration changes, and administrative actions. These logs provide forensic capabilities for investigating security incidents at the hypervisor level. ESX audit logging integrates with centralized log management to ensure comprehensive visibility across all infrastructure layers.

Platform supports native syslog forwarding from all components to external Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems. This enables centralized security monitoring, correlation with other security tools, and long-term log retention for compliance requirements. Integration with leading SIEM platforms provides real-time threat detection and automated incident response capabilities.

VCF Operations for Logs includes pre-built content packs with dashboards and alerts for security use cases. These content packs provide immediate visibility into failed login attempts, privilege escalations, compliance violations, and suspicious administrative activities. Content packs accelerate security monitoring deployment by providing tested queries, visualizations, and alert definitions based on VMware best practices.

Platform extends monitoring to containerized environments. It provides visibility into Kubernetes cluster health, namespace resource consumption, pod security violations, and container image vulnerabilities through integrated Harbor registry scanning. Network traffic analysis includes container-to-container communications with anomaly detection for cloud-native workloads.

VCF Operations includes rule-based and machine learning-based analytics for proactive threat detection and anomaly identification. VCF/TCP tracks configuration drift across all infrastructure components. Administrators can trace configuration changes back to specific users and timestamps.

VMware vDefend enables organizations to use custom and third-party threat intelligence. vDefend supports importing custom Intrusion Detection System/Intrusion Prevention System (IDS/IPS) signatures or those from third-party threat feeds. This enables tailored defenses against industry-specific attacks. Integration with Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs) such as Financial Services ISAC (FS-ISAC) or Health ISAC (H-ISAC) provides protection against targeted threats.

vDefend virtual patching capabilities allow deployment of custom IDS/IPS signatures to protect against vulnerabilities before official patches are available. vDefend signature bundle management includes version control, validation, and automated distribution across the infrastructure. vDefend multi-layer defense architecture provides comprehensive threat defense including IDS/IPS, malware prevention, and network detection and response.",Contributes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Live Recovery operates on an ad-hoc basis or as part of pre-existing playbooks and runbooks. It supports granular recovery time objectives (RTO) and recovery point objectives (RPO) configurable at the object level. Organizations can perform non-disruptive testing through VMware Live Site Recovery and NSX integration.

Platform supports multiple protection methods and recovery types. Datastore groups use array-based replication, individual virtual machines (VMs) use vSphere Replication, and VMware Virtual Volumes use policy-driven replication. Recovery types include planned migration for orderly evacuation and disaster recovery for unexpected site failures. Live Recovery extends vSAN Data Protection capabilities for remote cluster replication.

VMware Live Site Recovery integrates with third-party storage replication solutions and backup providers through standardized application programming interfaces (APIs) and VMware vStorage APIs for Data Protection (VADP). It supports flexible network connectivity options to meet data transfer requirements. VMware HCX and the core VCF platform offer data mobility and replication options both locally and to remote targets. Changed Block Tracking (CBT) tracks modified disk blocks to enable incremental backups, significantly reducing backup windows and storage requirements.

Platform provides snapshot capabilities on a per-workload basis for point-in-time recovery of virtual machines. vSAN Express Storage Architecture (ESA) delivers metadata-based snapshots with improved performance over traditional implementations. vSAN Data Protection allows snapshots to be replicated and stored externally to the datastore with automated scheduling and retention policies.

VMware Live Site Recovery implements comprehensive disaster recovery capabilities through protection groups and recovery plans that organize and automate the recovery process. VCF/TCP supports bidirectional protection where each site can serve as both protected and recovery site for different VM sets, orchestrating failover and failback operations with customizable recovery plans.
