# UK Telecommunications Security Code of Practice

The **Telecommunications Security Code of Practice** functions as the technical implementation guide for the *Telecommunications (Security) Act 2021* and the *Electronic Communications (Security Measures) Regulations 2022*. It establishes specific security standards for public telecommunications providers—differentiating between **Tier 1** (annual turnover ≥£1bn) and **Tier 2** (annual turnover ≥£50m) entities—to ensure the resilience of the UK's critical digital infrastructure. The Code details mandatory security outcomes regarding network architecture, supply chain monitoring, and data protection, while offering a "preferred approach" for compliance; providers may adopt alternative technical solutions only if they can demonstrate to the regulator, **Ofcom**, that these alternatives achieve equivalent security standards.
