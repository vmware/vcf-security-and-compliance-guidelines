# VMware vSphere 8 Default SSL/TLS Cipher Suites

Customers periodically inquire about which TLS cipher suites are supported by VMware vSphere. This resource outlines the default TLS settings, as verified experimentally with testssl.sh 3.0.8 using OpenSSL 3.0.8 (“testssl.sh -E host.name.com:443”). Ports & services using TLS were identified with nmap 7.70 (“nmap -p1-65535 -sT host.name.com”) and verified with OpenSSL (“openssl s\_client -connect host.name.com:443”). Products tested were in their default configurations with no additional hardening or configuration against their configured management IP address. The tested vCenter Server was version 8.0.2, and the tested VMware ESXi was 8.0.2.

While we strive for accuracy this is not a comprehensive list of ports and protocols, nor a comprehensive list of ports that are TLS-enabled. It is also limited to ingress/incoming connections to vSphere. Configurations and feature enablement differ between implementations and enabling certain features will enable additional listening network ports. For descriptions of ports & protocols please use ports.broadcom.com or the [vSphere Firewalling Helper](https://core.vmware.com/vsphere-firewalling-helper). The sample commands above were given so that interested people may be able to replicate these tests in their own environment. We encourage customers to take an active role in their security and compliance needs.

VMware vSphere 6.7 and newer default to only TLS 1.2. Unlike previous versions, **ESXi 8 cannot be downgraded to support TLS 1.0 or 1.1**.

Activating and deactivating particular ciphers is beyond the scope of this document and not recommended except under the direct guidance of VMware Global Support Services. Changes made by customers to cipher suites are not tested by VMware, may cause incompatibilities and system malfunctions, and may be inaccessible or overwritten during patching or updates. As you see below, vSphere TLS 1.2 implementations do not contain ciphers known to be insecure (DES, RC4, etc.), or ciphers less than 128 bits, and meet all current regulatory & compliance framework requirements. We routinely suggest to organizations that the relative risk of the default cipher settings be assessed in context with the overall security of the environment when organizations decide how to spend their limited staff time in pursuit of better security.

Services that are meant to be internal to vSphere have had their cipher lists condensed as part of our ongoing effort to improve security and reduce attack surface while retaining compatibility with supported versions of vSphere. Other services have cipher suites that are chosen specifically to maximize security while retaining necessary compatibility with the larger infrastructure ecosystem. Speaking specifically, Microsoft Windows Server 2012 is prevalent in data centers and the ecosystem at large, is supported by Microsoft until October 10, 2023, and requires some backwards compatibility in the cipher suites in order to permit connections. While many TLS "best practices" guides often specify more limited sets of ciphers, real-world constraints and context always factor into deployments. As mentioned above, all of the ciphers included in vSphere 8 are considered to be secure at this time.

Requests for changes to cipher suite defaults are feature requests and should be done through your account team or Technical Account Manager (TAM). Thank you.

HSTS
----

Please be aware that ESXi port 9080/tcp does not send HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) headers. HSTS helps protect browser connections against security downgrades. Some security scanning tools incorrectly flag the absence of HSTS on port 9080/tcp as a vulnerability, assuming that all TLS ports should be browser-compatible. However, port 9080/tcp is not a web server, does not support browser connections, and does not support unencrypted communications. Consequently, HSTS checks are irrelevant for this port. VMware is committed to reducing regulatory compliance friction for vSphere Administrators and plans to address this in future product versions.
