## How to Use This Repository
This repository is structured to accommodate different types of content. It is organized in a traditional manner using directory structure, which you can navigate at the top of the pages. This can be confusing at first, but once you get used to it will make sense. See the "Structure" section below.

> [!WARNING]
> There is content stored as PDFs, Excel spreadsheets, PowerShell scripts, Markdown files, and more. GitHub cannot display all of these files, and sometimes when it does, it changes the formatting or truncates the content.
> **If you encounter a PDF or other file you'd like the "raw" or native form of, use the "Download Raw File" button at the top of the page. It looks like a "down arrow."**

Information will be listed under the product and version it was developed for or with. Product versions may be up to three digits as needed. Use the most specific guidance available (for example, if you are using vSphere 8.0.2 you would choose 8.0.2 if it's present, or 8.0 if not).
