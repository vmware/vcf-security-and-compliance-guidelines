VMware software is used worldwide to securely and reliably host hundreds of millions of virtual machines. This repository contains technical security guidance, code samples, and other information designed to ease system design, system hardening, and regulatory compliance efforts. This guidance focuses on VMware Cloud Foundation and VMware vSphere Foundation.

## Resources & Links
The permanent link https://brcm.tech/vcf-security is being maintained as VMware documentation is assimilated into Broadcom. We understand that some organizations treat particular redirectors as security risks and block them. Please see [LINKS.md](https://github.com/vmware/vcf-security-and-compliance-guidelines/blob/main/LINKS.md) for more information and links to additional resources.

## Structure
This repository is structured to accommodate different types of content, and will be listed under the product and version it was developed for or with. Product versions may be up to three digits as needed. Use the most specific guidance available (for example, if you are using vSphere 8.0.2 you would choose 8.0.2 if it's present, or 8.0 if not).

* features-capabilities: information on specific features, functions, and capabilities in the products.
* ransomware-resources: information on defending against ransomware.
* regulatory-compliance: information on how the products work, and guidance on meeting regulatory compliance requirements using VMware products.
* security-advisories: information pertaining specifically to an individual VMware Security Advisory (VMSA).
* security-configuration-hardening-guide: security configuration and hardening baselines for VMware products.
* security-design: information useful when designing secure VMware Cloud Foundation environments.
