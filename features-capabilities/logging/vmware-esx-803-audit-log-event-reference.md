# VMware ESX 8.0.3 Audit Log Event Reference

This reference provides information about the audit records generated by VMware ESX in response to various security-related system events. This document also includes the parameters associated with each event. These audit records can be accessed locally on VMware ESX and can also be sent to remote log collectors. Both local storage and remote transmission are configurable capabilities of VMware ESX.

## VMware ESXi versus VMware ESX

With the release of VMware Cloud Foundation 9.0 the name of the VMware Hypervisor was changed from ESXi back to ESX. Documents such as this, which use information that span a range of release versions, may use the names ESXi and ESX interchangeably, or refer to the hypervisor solely as ESX for simplicity. Unless you are running VMware vSphere 4.1, please consider both ESXi and ESX to be the same, and use the product version to determine applicability to your environment.

# Enabling Audit Logging

Audit records are sent to the ESX vmsyslogd daemon for processing. Each record has a timestamp, the name of the reporting process, the PID of the reporting process, a syslog facility of 13 (audit), and a syslog severity (level) that is appropriate for the record. The vmsyslogd daemon, if enabled to do so, will store audit records locally and transmit audit records to external collectors (remote hosts). When transmitted, audit records also contain the name of the system from which they originated.

Audit logs on ESX are controlled by an additional set of parameters beyond traditional log forwarding. There is an order of operations for configuring these settings, and the parameters are listed in that order:

## Syslog.global.logHost

A comma-delimited list of remote logging endpoints to forward logs, including audit logs. Should be formatted with the protocol and port number, such as tcp://hostname:514, udp://hostname:514, or ssl://hostname:1514.

## Syslog.global.auditRecord.storageDirectory

Specifies the local ESX filesystem where audit logs will reside. By default, this will be set to /scratch/auditlog, which may be either a persistent filesystem or an in-memory filesystem, depending on the boot device for ESX.

You can detect if the scratch volume is temporary or persistent by querying the ScratchConfig.CurrentScratchLocation advanced parameter. If, when queried, it returns "/tmp/scratch" then the volume is temporary, and you should remap the audit record storage to a persistent device. USB and SD cards used as boot media should not be used as persistent devices as logging will wear them out.

If your only persistent device is a vSAN datastore you will need to configure syslog.global.vsanBacking to “TRUE” as well.

**This parameter must be configured before enabling audit logging**. To change it, disable audit logging.

## Syslog.global.auditRecord.storageCapacity

Specifies the capacity of the audit record storage directory, in MiB. **You cannot decrease this allocation once set**. However, it can be grown at any time. By default it is set to 4 and is recommended that it be set to 100.

## Syslog.global.auditRecord.storageEnable

Enables the local storage of audit records, into the directory specified by **s**yslog.global.auditRecord.storageDirectory. For best results configure the storage directory and the storage capacity before enabling audit logging.

This value is Boolean, TRUE or FALSE.

## Syslog.global.auditRecord.remoteEnable

Enables the transmission of audit records to the log hosts specified in Syslog.global.logHost.

This value is Boolean, TRUE or FALSE.

## PowerCLI Examples

VMware PowerCLI can be used to change these settings across multiple machines. As an example, this command will change a specific host’s log host setting:

Get-VMHost -Name \$ESX \| Get-AdvancedSetting Syslog.global.logHost \| Set-AdvancedSetting -Value “tcp://hostname:514”

Or change all hosts (be careful!):

Get-VMHost \| Get-AdvancedSetting Syslog.global.logHost \| Set-AdvancedSetting -Value “tcp://hostname:514”

VMware PowerCLI is easy to use and learn. For more information visit <https://developer.broadcom.com>.

## Additional Log Parameters

There are additional log handling parameters, please see the “[ESX Syslog Options](https://techdocs.broadcom.com/us/en/vmware-cis/vsphere/vsphere/8-0/esxi-installation-and-setup-8-0/installing-and-setting-up-esxi-install/setting-up-esxi-install/configuring-system-logging-install/esxi-syslog-options-install.html)” chapter in the product documentation.

# Audit Log Format

Audit logs are structured according to RFC 5424, and take the format:

[eventID@6876 paramName="paramValue" paramName="paramValue" ...]

RFC 5424 specifies that an SD-NAME must be a non-empty ASCII string which excludes whitespace, '=', ']', '"', and all control characters. It must be 32 characters or less in length.

“eventID@6876” is an RFC 5424 SD-ID (an SD-NAME). It consists of two parts: a name (which is used for the eventID) which additionally cannot contain an at-sign ('@'), and the VMware IANA private enterprise number of 6876, separated from the name by an at-sign ('@'). VMware restricts the length of the eventID such that the total SD-ID length is less than the maximum.

“paramName” is an RFC 5424 PARAM-NAME (an SD-NAME). The same paramName may be specified for multiple paramName="paramValue" entries.

“paramValue” is an RFC 5424 PARAM-VALUE, a UTF8 string. If the string contains '”' (double quotation mark), '\\' (backslash), or ']' (right bracket), these characters will be escaped with a preceding backslash ('\\'). A paramValue can be of any "reasonable" length (e.g. path names may be used). Note that a backslash followed by a character other than these characters is not an error from the standpoint of validation.

For example:

[syslog.mark@6876 subject="userName" object="syslog" result="success" comment="string"]

The order of parameters within the square brackets may change at any time. Do not depend on parameters having any specific order.

Logging inside VMware vSphere and VMware Cloud Foundation is standards-based and governed by several RFCs:

-   RFC 3164: <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3164>. Legacy (advisory) syslog format. Section 4.1.1 describes the PRI part (facility and severity) and also lists the numerical mappings ([https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3164\#section-4.1.1](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3164#section-4.1.1)).
-   RFC 3339: Date and Time on the Internet: Timestamps <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339>
-   RFC 5234: Augmented BNF for Syntax Specifications: ABNF <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5234>
-   RFC 5424: <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5424>. New syslog format. Section 6.2.1 describes the PRI part (facility and severity), and also lists the numerical mappings ([https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5424\#section-6.2.1](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5424#section-6.2.1)) which clarifies that the "audit" is number 13.
-   RFC 5425: Transport Layer Security (TLS) Transport Mapping for Syslog <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5425>
-   RFC 5427: <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5427>. This describes the facility and severity names and numerical mappings.
-   RFC 6587: Transmission of Syslog Messages over TCP [legacy] <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6587>
-   IANA Private Enterprise Numbers: <https://www.iana.org/assignments/enterprise-numbers/enterprise-numbers>. Catalog of all the private enterprise numbers when specifying the structured data. From the doc, the VMware private enterprise number is 6876.

Testing of log output can be done from the ESX command line. Please see the [relevant Knowledge Base article (KB 342571)](https://knowledge.broadcom.com/external/article/342571/using-syslog-log-markers-from-the-esxi-c.html).
