## Popular Topics

**Virtual TPM (vTPM)** is a popular, and often misunderstood, topic for customers. vTPM is rooted in the encryption capabilities of VMware vSphere and VMware Cloud Foundation, which is why it is in that directory. To use it, you need a key provider, such as Native Key Provider. It's very easy to configure and use. Visit the links below to get started.

## What about regulatory compliance?
Regulatory compliance is a process that periodically checks your environment for compliance with regulatory requirements. The third-party auditors that do this work are looking for how your environment implments security controls and security business processes. As such, being secure in the first place is key.
