# Code Samples: Key Providers

This directory contains code samples pertaining to encryption capabilities in VMware vSphere and VMware Cloud Foundation.

**audit-keyprovider.ps1**: This script is provided as an example of how to read encryption information from VMware vSphere and VMware Cloud Foundation.

**change-keyprovider.ps1**: This script is provided as an example of how to programmatically change key providers in VMware vSphere and VMware Cloud Foundation. **It will reset the key provider for all clusters, virtual machines, vSAN datastores, and ESX hosts to the specified key provider, doing a shallow rekey in the process.**
