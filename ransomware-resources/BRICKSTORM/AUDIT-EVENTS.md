## 1. VM Lifecycle Events (CRITICAL)

These events are essential for detecting BRICKSTORM's credential extraction technique (clone VM, extract credentials, delete VM).

### VM Operations (VMware ESX Audit Log)

| Event | Source | Priority | Description | BRICKSTORM Relevance |
|-------|--------|----------|-------------|---------------------|
| `vm.create` | ESX | ⚠️ HIGH | VM creation attempted | New staging VM creation |
| `vm.delete` | ESX | ⛔ CRITICAL | VM deletion attempted | Covering tracks after credential extraction |
| `vm.reconfigure` | ESX | ⛔ CRITICAL | VM reconfiguration attempted | **Disk swap attack**: attaching DC disks to staging VM |
| `vm.register` | ESX | 🔵 MEDIUM | VM registered | Rogue VM registration |
| `vm.kill` | ESX | ⚠️ HIGH | VM forcefully terminated | Abnormal VM termination |
| `vm.power.on` | ESX | 🔵 MEDIUM | VM power on attempted | Staging VM activation |
| `vm.power.off` | ESX | 🔵 MEDIUM | VM power off attempted | Pre-deletion activity |
| `vm.snapshot.create` | ESX | ⚠️ HIGH | Snapshot creation attempted | Data capture technique |
| `vm.snapshot.remove` | ESX | 🔵 MEDIUM | Snapshot removal attempted | Cleanup activity |
| `vm.snapshot.revert` | ESX | 🔵 MEDIUM | Snapshot revert attempted | May indicate testing/evasion |

### VM Storage Events - Disk Swap Detection (VMware ESX Audit Log)

| Event | Source | Priority | Description | BRICKSTORM Relevance |
|-------|--------|----------|-------------|---------------------|
| `vm.storage.add` | ESX | ⛔ CRITICAL | Disk attached to VM | **Key indicator**: DC/vault disk attached to different VM |
| `vm.storage.edit` | ESX | ⚠️ HIGH | VM storage configuration changed | Disk reconfiguration |
| `vm.storage.remove` | ESX | ⚠️ HIGH | Disk removed from VM | Cleanup after extraction |

**Disk Swap Alert Criteria for `vm.storage.add`**:

Alert when a Domain Controller or credential store disk is attached to any non-DC virtual machine:

```bash
# In vm.storage.add event, check the vmdk parameter
# Alert if vmdk path contains a Critical VM name AND target VM is not the disk owner

# Example suspicious event:
#   Event: vm.storage.add
#   Target VM: "staging-vm-temp"
#   vmdk: "[datastore1] DC01/DC01.vmdk"   <-- DC disk attached to non-DC VM
```

See [Rule 8: Disk Swap Attack](#rule-8-disk-swap-attack-vcenter) for detailed detection logic and SIEM query examples.

### VM Migration Events - Pre-Clone Staging (VMware ESX Audit Log)

Attackers may use vMotion or Storage vMotion to move a Domain Controller to a compromised host or less-monitored datastore before cloning, avoiding detection on the primary production cluster.

| Event | Source | Priority | Description | BRICKSTORM Relevance |
|-------|--------|----------|-------------|---------------------|
| `vm.migrate` | ESX | ⚠️ HIGH | VM vMotion initiated | DC moved to compromised host |
| `vm.storage.migrate` | ESX | ⚠️ HIGH | Storage vMotion initiated | DC moved to attacker-controlled storage |
| `vm.relocate` | ESX | ⚠️ HIGH | VM relocated (compute + storage) | Full VM relocation |

**Detection Rule**: Alert when ANY migration event targets a Critical VM (Domain Controller, CA, vault) and the destination is:
- A non-production cluster
- A datastore not in the approved list for that VM class
- A host outside the secured management cluster

```
# VCF Operations for Logs query
eventTypeId:(vm.migrate OR vm.storage.migrate OR vm.relocate) AND vm.name:(*DC* OR *domain* OR *vault* OR *CA*)
```

### Detection Pattern: Clone-Extract-Delete

Alert when these events occur in sequence within 24 hours for the same VM:
1. `vm.create` or `vm.register`
2. `vm.storage.add` (especially if attaching disk from critical VM)
3. `vm.power.on`
4. `vm.power.off`
5. `vm.delete`

---

## 2. Authentication and Session Events (HIGH)

### SSH Events (VMware ESX)

| Event | Source | Priority | Description | BRICKSTORM Relevance |
|-------|--------|----------|-------------|---------------------|
| `ssh.connect` | ESX | ⚠️ HIGH | SSH connection attempt | Direct host access |
| `ssh.disconnect` | ESX | ⬜ LOW | SSH connection ended | Session tracking |
| `ssh.session.begin` | ESX | ⚠️ HIGH | SSH session started | Interactive access established |
| `ssh.session.end` | ESX | ⬜ LOW | SSH session ended | Session tracking |
| `ssh.cmd` | ESX | ⛔ CRITICAL | Shell command executed via SSH | **Command execution monitoring** |

#### vpxuser SSH Monitoring

The `vpxuser` account is created by vCenter to manage VMware ESX hosts and has root-equivalent privileges. UNC5221 extracts vpxuser credentials from compromised vCenter and uses them to SSH into VMware ESX hosts.

**Distinguishing Legitimate from Malicious vpxuser Activity**:
- **Legitimate**: vCenter uses vpxuser for non-interactive, automated host management (API calls, configuration pushes). These operations do not generate `ssh.session.begin` events.
- **Malicious**: Interactive SSH sessions by vpxuser (generates `ssh.session.begin`) indicate an attacker has extracted credentials and is manually accessing hosts.

**Critical Alert**: Any `ssh.session.begin` event where the user is `vpxuser` warrants immediate investigation. This pattern indicates credential extraction and lateral movement, not normal vCenter operations.

```
# Alert criteria
Event: ssh.session.begin
User: vpxuser
Priority: ⛔ CRITICAL
```

### DCUI Events (VMware ESX)

| Event | Source | Priority | Description | BRICKSTORM Relevance |
|-------|--------|----------|-------------|---------------------|

| `esx.audit.dcui.login.failed` | ESX | ⚠️ HIGH | DCUI login failed | Brute force attempts |
| `esx.audit.dcui.login.passwd.changed` | ESX | ⛔ CRITICAL | DCUI password changed | Credential manipulation |

### VIM API Sessions (VMware ESX)

| Event | Source | Priority | Description | BRICKSTORM Relevance |
|-------|--------|----------|-------------|---------------------|
| `vim.connect` | ESX | 🔵 MEDIUM | VIM API connection established | API access |

---

## 4. Service Management Events (HIGH)

### Service State Changes (VMware ESX)

| Event | Source | Priority | Description | BRICKSTORM Relevance |
|-------|--------|----------|-------------|---------------------|
| `service.start` | ESX | ⚠️ HIGH | Service start attempted | SSH/Shell enablement |
| `service.stop` | ESX | 🔵 MEDIUM | Service stop attempted | Security service disabled |
| `service.restart` | ESX | 🔵 MEDIUM | Service restart attempted | Service manipulation |
| `service.updatepolicy` | ESX | ⚠️ HIGH | Service startup policy changed | Persistence (auto-start SSH) |
| `service.uninstall` | ESX | ⚠️ HIGH | Service uninstall attempted | Security software removal |

| `firewall.enable` | ESX | ⬜ LOW | Firewall enabled | Normal operation |
| `firewall.ruleset.enable` | ESX | ⚠️ HIGH | Firewall ruleset enabled | Rule change |
| `firewall.ruleset.disable` | ESX | ⚠️ HIGH | Firewall ruleset disabled | Rule weakening |
| `firewall.ruleset.update` | ESX | 🔵 MEDIUM | Firewall ruleset updated | Configuration change |
| `firewall.update` | ESX | 🔵 MEDIUM | Firewall default policy updated | Policy change |

---

## 6. Time Configuration Events (HIGH)

Attackers manipulate time to evade detection and corrupt forensic timelines.

| Event | Source | Priority | Description | BRICKSTORM Relevance |
|-------|--------|----------|-------------|---------------------|
| `time.ntp.disable` | ESX | ⚠️ HIGH | NTP disabled | Time manipulation setup |
| `time.ntp.enable` | ESX | ⬜ LOW | NTP enabled | Normal operation |
| `time.ntp.set.servers` | ESX | 🔵 MEDIUM | NTP servers changed | Potential redirection |
| `time.set.systemclock` | ESX | ⛔ CRITICAL | System clock manually set | **Timestomping indicator** |
| `time.monitoring.disable` | ESX | ⚠️ HIGH | Time monitoring disabled | Evasion technique |
| `time.monitoring.enable` | ESX | ⬜ LOW | Time monitoring enabled | Normal operation |
| `esx.problem.clock.skew` | ESX | ⚠️ HIGH | Clock skew detected | Time drift/manipulation |
| `esx.problem.clock.parameter.set.maxPosPhaseCorrection` | ESX | ⛔ CRITICAL | NTP correction parameter changed | **Timestomping setup**: Allows large time jumps without detection |

**Why Time Manipulation Matters**: Attackers modify `maxPosPhaseCorrection` to allow large time adjustments that would normally be rejected by NTP. This enables backdating malicious activity to appear as if it occurred during a different timeframe, corrupting forensic timelines and potentially placing attacker activity outside your log retention window.

---

## 7. VIB/Software Events (CRITICAL)

| Event | Source | Priority | Description | BRICKSTORM Relevance |
|-------|--------|----------|-------------|---------------------|
| `vib.install` | ESX | ⛔ CRITICAL | VIB installation attempted | **Malware/backdoor installation** |
| `vib.remove` | ESX | ⚠️ HIGH | VIB removal attempted | Security software removal |

### Detection Pattern

Any `vib.install` event outside of scheduled maintenance windows should trigger immediate investigation.

---

## 8. Shell Command Execution (CRITICAL)

| Event | Source | Priority | Description | BRICKSTORM Relevance |
|-------|--------|----------|-------------|---------------------|
| `shell.cmd` | ESX | ⛔ CRITICAL | Shell command completed | **Command execution audit** |
| `ssh.cmd` | ESX | ⛔ CRITICAL | SSH command executed | **Remote command execution** |

### Forensic Limitations

**What these events capture:**
- Command string executed (e.g., `cat /etc/shadow`)
- Timestamp and user context
- Success/failure status

**What these events do NOT capture:**
- Command output (results of the command)
- Interactive session content (vi/vim editing, interactive prompts)
- Piped data or heredoc content
- File contents read or written

**Mitigating the Gap:**

| Approach | Implementation |
|----------|----------------|
| **Restricted shell access** | Minimize SSH/Shell enablement windows; disable when not in active use |
| **Correlate with file events** | Cross-reference `shell.cmd` with file integrity monitoring to infer what was modified |

This limitation means attackers can execute commands to view sensitive data (e.g., `cat /etc/shadow`) and the audit log will show the command was run, but not what data was extracted.

### High-Risk Command Patterns

Monitor `shell.cmd` and `ssh.cmd` events for these patterns:

| Pattern | Risk | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| `esxcli system settings kernel set` | ⛔ CRITICAL | Kernel parameter changes (execInstalledOnly) |
| `vim-cmd vmsvc/` | ⚠️ HIGH | VM operations via command line |
| `esxcli network firewall` | ⚠️ HIGH | Firewall manipulation |
| `esxcli software vib` | ⛔ CRITICAL | Software installation |
| `chmod`, `chown` | 🔵 MEDIUM | Permission changes |
| `cp`, `mv` to `/etc/` paths | ⚠️ HIGH | System file modification |
| `curl`, `wget` | ⛔ CRITICAL | External file download |

| `com.vmware.vc.guestOperations.GuestOperationAuthFailure` | vCenter | ⚠️ HIGH | Guest operation auth failed | Unauthorized guest access attempt |

**Critical Alert: Guest Operations on Domain Controllers**

VMware Tools guest operations allow file transfers, process execution, and registry access from vCenter directly into VMs, bypassing network-level controls. Guest operations require authentication to the guest OS, though if attackers have extracted credentials via VM cloning, they can use guest operations to:
- Execute commands inside Domain Controllers
- Extract additional credentials (NTDS.dit, registry hives)
- Deploy persistence mechanisms inside critical VMs
- Exfiltrate data without network visibility

**Detection Rule**: Alert on ANY `com.vmware.vc.guestOperations.GuestOperation` event where the target VM is:
- A Domain Controller
- A Certificate Authority
- A password vault or credential store
- Any VM in your Critical VM list

```
# VCF Operations for Logs query

## 15. Hypervisor Implant Detection (CRITICAL)

UNC5221 deploys specialized implants (Junction, GuestConduit) that use VSOCK to bypass network security. These events help detect this activity.

### VSOCK and Network Connection Events

| Event | Source | Priority | Description | BRICKSTORM Relevance |
|-------|--------|----------|-------------|---------------------|
| `network.listen.start` | ESX | ⚠️ HIGH | Process starts listening on port | Junction listens on port 8090 |
| `network.connect` | ESX | 🔵 MEDIUM | Outbound connection initiated | C2 communication |

### Detection Commands for Junction/GuestConduit

These implants may not generate standard audit events. Use active detection:

```bash
# On VMware ESX: Check for Junction (port 8090)
esxcli network ip connection list | grep -E ":8090.*LISTEN"

# On VMware ESX: Check for suspicious processes masquerading as vvold
ps -c | grep vvold

# On VMware ESX: Check all listeners for unexpected ports
esxcli network ip connection list | grep LISTEN

# On Guest VMs: Check for GuestConduit (VSOCK port 5555)
ss -x -l | grep -i vsock
```

### Process Monitoring

| Indicator | Description | Detection |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| **vvold masquerade** | Junction disguises itself as vvold | Compare process binary hash against known-good |
| **Port 8090 listener** | Junction default listening port | Monitor `esxcli network ip connection list` |
| **VSOCK port 5555** | GuestConduit default port | Check guest VMs for VSOCK listeners |

## 16. BRICKSTEAL Detection (CRITICAL)

BRICKSTEAL is an in-memory Java servlet filter that captures vCenter administrator credentials.

### vCenter Configuration Events

| Indicator | Location | Detection Method |
|-----------|----------|------------------|
| **Servlet filter addition** | `web.xml` | File integrity monitoring |
| **Tomcat restart** | vCenter service | Service restart events outside maintenance |
| **URI monitoring** | `/websso/SAML2/SSO/*` | BRICKSTEAL hooks these authentication URIs |

### Detection Procedure

```bash
# On vCenter: Check for unexpected servlet filters
grep -r "filter-class" /usr/lib/vmware-sso/vmware-sts/webapps/

# Compare web.xml against known baseline

## VCF Operations for Logs Queries

> **Timezone Note**: The attacker operational window (01:00-10:00 UTC) must be converted to your SIEM's log ingestion timezone. Many SIEMs index logs in local time or a configured timezone, not UTC. Verify how your logs are timestamped before deploying time-based detection rules.

## Correlation Rules

### Rule 1: VM Credential Extraction Pattern

**Trigger**: The following sequence within 24 hours:
1. `vm.create` or `vm.storage.add`
2. `vm.power.on`
3. `vm.power.off`
4. `vm.delete` or `vm.storage.remove`

**Priority**: ⛔ CRITICAL

### Rule 2: SSH Enabled + Command Execution

**Trigger**:
1. `service.start` where object contains "SSH"
2. Followed by `ssh.cmd` events

**Priority**: ⛔ CRITICAL

### Rule 3: Security Bypass Attempt

**Trigger**: Any of:
- `configenc.reqeio.disable`
- `configenc.reqsb.disable`
- `firewall.disable`

**Priority**: ⛔ CRITICAL

### Rule 4: Time Manipulation

**Trigger**:
- `time.set.systemclock`
- `time.ntp.disable` followed by `time.ntp.set.servers`

**Priority**: ⚠️ HIGH

### Rule 5: Off-Hours Administrative Activity

**Trigger**: Any CRITICAL or HIGH priority event occurring between 01:00-10:00 UTC

**Why This Window Matters**: BRICKSTORM operators have been observed conducting interactive operations during 01:00-10:00 UTC, which corresponds to PRC (Beijing) business hours (09:00-18:00 CST). While your organization may have legitimate after-hours maintenance, VM cloning, account creation, or privilege changes during this specific window warrant elevated scrutiny.

> **Caveat**: This time window is based on observed operational patterns and is not universal. Threat actors adapt their schedules and may operate outside these hours to evade detection or accommodate different operators. Use this as one signal among many, not as a definitive indicator.

**Timezone Conversion** (convert to your local timezone for SIEM rules):

| UTC | Beijing (CST) | U.S. Eastern | U.S. Pacific | London (GMT) | Sydney (AEDT) |
|-----|---------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|---------------|
| 01:00 | 09:00 | 20:00 (prev day) | 17:00 (prev day) | 01:00 | 12:00 |
| 10:00 | 18:00 | 05:00 | 02:00 | 10:00 | 21:00 |

> **Note for Tier 1 Analysts**: This time window is based on observed threat actor operational patterns. Convert 01:00-10:00 UTC to your local timezone when configuring alerts. Events during this window are not automatically malicious, but warrant additional investigation, especially for VM cloning, account changes, or privilege escalation.

**Priority**: ⚠️ HIGH (elevated from base priority)

### Rule 6: Temporary Account Creation

**Trigger**: `account.create` followed by `account.delete` for same account within 7 days

**Priority**: ⛔ CRITICAL

### Rule 7: VM Clone-Delete Pattern (vCenter)

**Trigger**: The following vCenter events in sequence within 24 hours:
1. `VmClonedEvent` where source VM is in Critical VM list
2. `VmPoweredOnEvent` for cloned VM
3. `VmPoweredOffEvent` for cloned VM
4. `VmRemovedEvent` for cloned VM

**Detection Logic**:

```
Alert when ALL conditions are true:
  1. VmClonedEvent where source VM is in Critical VM list
  2. User is NOT in Backup Service Accounts list
  3. Clone followed by deletion within 24 hours
```

**Tuning Note**: Backup solutions clone VMs for backup operations. Whitelist backup service accounts (e.g., `svc-backup@vsphere.local`) by username, not just by target VM. This prevents false positives while still detecting attackers who compromise vCenter but use their own accounts.

**Priority**: ⛔ CRITICAL

### Rule 8: Disk Swap and Snapshot Attack (vCenter)

**Attack Description**: Attackers extract NTDS.dit without cloning the entire VM using two techniques:

1. **Disk Swap**: Attach a Domain Controller's virtual disk to a staging VM
2. **Snapshot Mount**: Snapshot the DC, mount the snapshot disk (avoids file locks on the running VM), copy data, then delete the snapshot to cover tracks

**Trigger**: Any of:
- `VmReconfiguredEvent` or `vm.storage.add` where a Domain Controller disk is attached to a non-DC virtual machine
- `VmSnapshotCreatedEvent` followed by `VmReconfiguredEvent` (disk add) followed by `VmSnapshotRemovedEvent` within 24 hours for a critical VM

**Detection Logic**:

```
Alert when ALL conditions are true:
  1. Event type is VmReconfiguredEvent (vCenter) or vm.storage.add (ESX)
  2. Device change operation = "add" for virtual disk
  3. Disk path (vmdk) belongs to a VM in your Critical VM list (see below)
  4. Target VM is NOT the same VM that owns the disk
  5. Target VM is NOT in your Critical VM list
  6. Target VM is NOT in your Backup Proxy whitelist (see tuning note)
  7. User is NOT in Backup Service Accounts list
```

**Hot-Add Detection (Higher Confidence)**:

Attaching a disk to a running VM is rarer and more suspicious than attaching during maintenance. Add an elevated priority rule:

```
Alert (CRITICAL) when ALL conditions are true:
  1. VmReconfiguredEvent with device change operation = "add"
  2. Disk path belongs to Critical VM list
  3. Target VM runtime.powerState = "poweredOn"
```

Hot-add to a running VM bypasses the normal workflow of powering off before reconfiguration, indicating either urgency or an attempt to avoid triggering power-state monitoring.

**Tuning Note**: Backup solutions often attach disks to proxy VMs for backup operations. Without whitelisting, this rule generates false positives during backup windows.

- **Whitelist by MoRef ID, not VM name**: Use the VM's Managed Object Reference ID (e.g., `vm-1234`) rather than display name. Attackers can rename a staging VM to `Veeam-Proxy-99`, but they cannot spoof the MoRef ID of a legitimate proxy.
- **Time-bound exceptions**: Alert on backup proxy activity outside scheduled backup windows
- **Target validation**: Alert if backup proxies attach disks from VMs they don't normally back up

**Critical VM List** (maintain this list in your SIEM):
- All Domain Controllers
- Certificate Authorities
- Password vaults / secret stores
- Backup servers
- VMs with names matching: `*DC*`, `*domain*`, `*vault*`, `*password*`, `*cred*`, `*backup*`, `*CA*`

**Key Fields to Extract**:

| Field | Location | Purpose |
|-------|----------|---------|
| `vm` | Event root | Target VM receiving the disk |
| `configSpec.deviceChange[].device.backing.fileName` | VmReconfiguredEvent | VMDK path being attached |
| `configSpec.deviceChange[].operation` | VmReconfiguredEvent | Should be "add" |
| `vmdk` | vm.storage.add | Disk path on ESX |

**Example SIEM Query (Pseudocode)**:

```
-- IMPORTANT: Replace the LIKE pattern with an exact list of your Tier 0 VMs
-- Using LIKE '%DC%' causes false positives on VMs with "DC" in the name (e.g., "WebDC", "MYDC-TEST")
--
-- TIMEZONE: Convert 01:00-10:00 UTC to your SIEM's ingestion timezone.
-- Many SIEMs index logs in local time. Verify your log timestamps before deploying.

SELECT * FROM vcenter_events
WHERE EventType = 'VmReconfiguredEvent'
  AND configSpec.deviceChange.operation = 'add'
  AND configSpec.deviceChange.device.backing.fileName IN (
    '[datastore1] DC01/DC01.vmdk',
    '[datastore1] DC02/DC02.vmdk',
    '[datastore1] CA01/CA01.vmdk',
    '[datastore1] VAULT01/VAULT01.vmdk'
    -- Add all your Tier 0 VM disk paths here
  )
  AND vm.name NOT IN (SELECT name FROM critical_vms)
  AND timestamp BETWEEN '01:00:00' AND '10:00:00' -- UTC; convert to your SIEM timezone
```

**Priority**: ⛔ CRITICAL

**Response**: Immediately investigate the target VM, the user who performed the operation, and capture memory/disk before any remediation.

### Rule 9: Permission Escalation

**Trigger**: Any of:
- `PermissionAddedEvent` granting Administrator role
- `RoleUpdatedEvent` adding sensitive privileges
- Multiple `PermissionAddedEvent` in short timeframe

**Priority**: ⚠️ HIGH

### Rule 10: Security Feature Disabled (vCenter-Relayed)

**Trigger**: Any of:
- `esx.audit.lockdownmode.disabled`
- `esx.audit.uw.security.User.ExecInstalledOnly.disabled`
- `esx.audit.net.firewall.disabled`

**Priority**: ⛔ CRITICAL

### Rule 11: execInstalledOnly Violation

**Trigger**: `esx.audit.uw.security.execInstalledOnly.violation`

**Priority**: ⛔ CRITICAL (indicates active attack blocked by security control)

### Rule 12: Alarm Tampering

**Trigger**: `AlarmRemovedEvent` or `AlarmReconfiguredEvent` for security-related alarms

**Priority**: ⚠️ HIGH (possible detection evasion)

### Rule 13: vpxuser SSH Lateral Movement

**Trigger**: `ssh.session.begin` where user is `vpxuser`

**Context**: The vpxuser account is used by vCenter for host management automation. Interactive SSH sessions by this account indicate an attacker has compromised vCenter and is moving laterally to VMware ESX hosts.

**Priority**: ⛔ CRITICAL

### Rule 14: Junction/GuestConduit Activity

**Trigger**: Any of:
- Process listening on port 8090
- Process named `vvold` with unexpected binary hash
- VSOCK listeners on port 5555 inside guest VMs

**Priority**: ⛔ CRITICAL

### Rule 15: BRICKSTEAL Deployment Indicators

**Trigger**: Sequence within 24 hours:
1. vCenter SSH enabled (`esx.audit.ssh.enabled` or equivalent on VCSA)
2. SSH session to vCenter
3. Tomcat or vmware-stsd service restart
4. web.xml file modification detected

**Priority**: ⛔ CRITICAL

### Rule 16: Rogue VM Deployment (T1564.006)

**Attack Description**: BRICKSTORM provides attackers with persistent vCenter access, enabling them to deploy hidden VMs for staging, data exfiltration, or backup persistence. These rogue VMs may survive BRICKSTORM removal if not detected, providing attackers a way back into the environment.

**Trigger**: Any of:
- `VmCreatedEvent` where VM name does not match naming convention
- `VmCreatedEvent` where target folder is not in approved folder list
- `VmRegisteredEvent` outside change management window
- `VmCreatedEvent` followed by VM remaining powered off for extended period

**Detection Logic**:

```
Alert when ANY condition is true:
  1. VmCreatedEvent with VM name not in approved naming pattern
  2. VmCreatedEvent with folder not in approved folder list
  3. VmCreatedEvent during 01:00-10:00 UTC (operational hours)
  4. VmRegisteredEvent for VM not previously in inventory
  5. Multiple VmCreatedEvents in short timeframe (bulk deployment)
```

**VCF Operations for Logs Query**:

```
eventTypeId:(VmCreatedEvent OR VmRegisteredEvent)
```

Filter results against your approved VM naming patterns and folder structure.

**Priority**: ⚠️ HIGH (CRITICAL if during operational hours 01:00-10:00 UTC)

## Log Retention Recommendations

**Dwell time** is the period between initial compromise and detection. BRICKSTORM's average dwell time of **393 days** means attackers typically operate undetected for over a year. Standard 30-90 day log retention results in loss of evidence from the initial compromise by the time an intrusion is discovered.

| Log Type | Minimum Retention | Recommended Retention | Rationale |
|----------|-------------------|----------------------|-----------|
| VMware ESX Audit Logs | 1 year | 2 years | Capture initial persistence setup |
| vCenter Task/Event Database | 1 year | 2 years | Track VM cloning operations |
| Authentication Logs | 1 year | 2 years | Correlate access patterns over time |
| Shell Command Logs | 1 year | 2 years | Evidence of attacker commands |
| Firewall Logs | 1 year | 2 years | Network behavior patterns |

**Critical considerations:**

- With 393-day average dwell time, 90-day retention means you will have **no logs** from the initial 300+ days of compromise
- When an intrusion is discovered, the question "how did they get in?" often cannot be answered because those logs are gone
- Consider **immutable log storage** to prevent attackers from deleting evidence during their extended access period
- Forward logs to a **separate, isolated SIEM** that attackers cannot access even with vCenter administrative credentials
