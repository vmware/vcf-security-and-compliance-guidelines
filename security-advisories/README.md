# VMware Security Advisory Resources

> [!WARNING]
> This is not the official location for VMware Security Advisories. Please visit https://www.broadcom.com/support/vmware-security-advisories for the authoritative source.

This area of the VCF Security & Compliance Guidelines repository is dedicated to supporting VMware Cloud Foundation Security Advisories, by answering questions and providing examples where possible, in an effort to help customers and partners be secure. There will not be content here for every security advisory, just advisories that may have additional context and considerations for remediation and mitigation beyond updating the product.

The authoritative source for security advisories is at:

[https://www.broadcom.com/support/vmware-security-advisories](https://www.broadcom.com/support/vmware-security-advisories)

and you can -- and should -- sign up for email notification with the link on that page.

There are not currently any automated feeds for security vulnerability information.
