# VMware Security Advisory Resources

This area of the VCF Security & Compliance Guidelines repository is dedicated to supporting VMware Cloud Foundation Security Advisories, by answering questions and providing examples where possible, in an effort to help customers and partners be secure.

The authoritative source for security advisories is at:

[https://support.broadcom.com/web/ecx/security-advisory?segment=VC](https://support.broadcom.com/web/ecx/security-advisory?segment=VC)

and you can -- and should -- sign up for email notification with the link on that page.

There are not currently any automated feeds for security vulnerability information.
